# Visualization and Analysis of Philadelphia Murals 
Personal dataset project for Math-144-01: Foundations of Data Science
# Visualization
This bar chart shows the number of murals in each Philadelphia zipcode and how they are distributed among different artists. While most zipcodes have only one mural represented, 19107 has several. The area's high concentration of murals suggests that it may be a hotspot for public art in the city. However, the range of zipcodes reveal that murals can be found across Philadelphia. The variety of colors also show that many artists contribute to public art in Philadelphia. In contrast to the zipcodes, no particular artist is creating more murals than another. This suggests that the public art scene attracts many artists and is a flourishing, collaborative sector.

# Analysis 
For my analytical technique, I choose to conduct simple EDA. I created a boxplot and calculated the summary statistics of the number of words in each mural tile in my dataset. The boxplot and summary statistics revealed that the shortest title had only one word (“Lengendary”), and the longest had five ("A Love Letter for You"). On average, the titles in my dataset contained around three words. I wanted to explore how much meaning could be derived from the titles and how this might impact a viewers' interpretation of the murals. By analyzing the number of words each title, it was revealed how concise mural titles typically are, leaving viewers to imagine and interpret the artwork independently.
