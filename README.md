# Analysis 
This visualization shows the number of murals in each Philadelphia zipcode and how they are distributed among different artists. While most zipcodes have only one mural represented, 19107 has several. The area's high concentration of murals suggests that it may be a hotspot for public art in the city. However, the range of zipcodes reveal that murals can be found across Philadelphia. The variety of colors also show that many artists contribute to public art in Philadelphia. In contrast to the zipcode, no particular artist is creating more murals than another. This suggests that the public art scene attracts many artists and is a flourishing, collaborative sector.
